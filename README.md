# Reversi-Game

This project is a game of reversi between two players rather than a player and a computer. Player 1 will be white and Player 2 will be black. In this variation of Reversi, only horizontal and vertical outflankings score points. No diagonals. Game will be limited by a number of rounds set by the players.
